## tinyconnection: Minimal Yet Compliant Connection Creator

### Motivation

Connections in R are wonderful. Oddly the API (at the C level) is also hidden. This package explores
creating a new connection without running afoul of checks.

### Lineage

The package is a smaller variant of the [rconnection](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/rconnection)
package which provides more context around connections.
